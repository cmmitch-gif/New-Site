# Mitchell — Portfolio Site

Static HTML/CSS site. No frameworks. Accent colour: #A3E43A. Font: Host Grotesk.

## Quick edits
- Replace placeholders in `/index.html` project cards with images in `/images/` and real links to case studies (add pages later).
- Update the LinkedIn href in nav.
- Paste real About copy into `about.html` (from mitchellgrimes.com/about.html).
- Drop `resume.pdf` if you ever want it (menu currently excludes it).

## Images
- Save covers as 1200×800 JPG/PNG in `/images/`: `citeready.jpg`, `arcteryx-crm.jpg`, `etrnl-welcome.jpg`.
- Add `images/og.jpg` for social sharing.

## Deploy
Any static host works. For Vercel:
1. Create a new Git repo and push.
2. Import to Vercel → Framework: “Other”.
3. Root = `/` (no build step).
